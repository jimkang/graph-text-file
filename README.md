### As a component

Then, in your code:

    graphArray({
      id: 'unique-id',
      array: [0, 1, 0, -1],
      containerSelector: '#parent-div-id',
      onError: error => console.log(error),
      fitToParentWidth: true,
      zoomable: true, // Specify true if you want this function to set up d3-zoom on the graph so users can zoom and pan with the mouse and touch.
      yBounds: [-2, 2],
      maxMagToShow: 10, // Just don't graph values beyond 10 and -10; leave this out to graph them all.
    });
